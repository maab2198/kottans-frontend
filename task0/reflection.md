1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - The diff command helped us to see the difference between two versions and we saw that "space" changed unpredictably.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    - It's useful for bug-fixing and experiments because we are able to come back to the checked and reliable position

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Google 
    - New information is allways saved 
    - Saving with regular intervals
    - Useful for fast-writing documents or like a store for files 

    Git
    - You can control what and when to save 
    - Every commit make sense (or not))) and pretty name
    - It easy to work with commit history
    - Usefull for long and changeable projects (writing a novel)

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    - Google Docs work with one single document, git is for projects, if some file changes it meters for the whole project 

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - git log - show commits history 
    - git diff - changes between 2 commits

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    - Possibility to come to the fixed point if something goes wrong

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    - For  kottans :smiley_cat:
